This is a program to encypt and decrypt messages.

To use this program, you must have an Encryption Key (EK) ready.
There is a sample one available as [List0.txt](https://github.com/DitherDude/Seeder2/edit/master/List0.txt), but you can make your own at [random.org](https://www.random.org/sequences/?min=1&max=200&col=1&base=10&format=html&rnd=new) and selecting the first 97 numbers, and pasting them into a txt file.
The program will notify you of any errors within the EK (if any).

Characters that are currently supported for encryption are ```ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnoqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()`~-=_+[]\{}|;':",./<>? {Space} {NewLine}```.
